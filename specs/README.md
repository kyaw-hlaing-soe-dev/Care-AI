# CareAI Specifications

**Status:** Active  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-15

CareAI is a responsive health-vital tracking web application. The active Spark-plan architecture uses Firebase Authentication plus direct, owner-scoped Cloud Firestore access from the frontend. The previous Cloud Functions/OpenRouter backend remains in `backend/` as inactive reference code and is not part of the free-plan deployment. Firestore rules/indexes are deployed to `care-ai-4eb8d`; Google-provider and full browser E2E verification remain outstanding.

## MVP status

The UI MVP and Spark-compatible data path are substantially implemented. Authenticated profile, vital, dashboard, and history operations use direct Firestore access under the signed-in UID; legacy local records are deliberately cleared once rather than silently imported. AI/OpenRouter analysis and trusted server validation are unavailable in this mode. The system is not production-ready until Firestore rules deployment and the remaining QA checks are completed.

## Technology summary

- **Current active implementation:** TanStack Start, React 19, TypeScript, React Query, Firebase Authentication, and direct Cloud Firestore access protected by security rules.
- **Inactive reference backend:** Firebase Cloud Functions, Firebase Admin, and server-only OpenRouter code under `backend/`; it requires a billing-enabled deployment and is not called by the frontend.
- **Deployment target:** the Firebase Spark project `care-ai-4eb8d`; Storage remains deny-by-default until a file feature is approved.

| Automated tests                                | PARTIAL     | deterministic-score, validation, provider, and Firestore owner-rule suites pass; Storage test exists but its emulator runtime download and broader integration/E2E coverage remain unverified |

## How AI coding agents must use these specs

1. Read this file first.
2. Locate the feature specification and its requirement ID.
3. Read the related architecture, security, data, and acceptance-criteria specifications.
4. Inspect the existing implementation before changing it.
5. Implement only the scoped requirement and its necessary dependencies.
6. Run the specified tests and responsive checks.
7. Update the affected spec whenever behavior, schema, or a requirement status changes.
8. Never silently contradict a specification, alter the score algorithm, expose a secret, or trust a client-provided UID.

The delivery workflow is: **requirement → relevant spec → acceptance criteria → implementation plan → code → tests → verification → spec update**.
